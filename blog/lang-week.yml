    I recently had an idea for something I thought would be cool to do. The idea itself is simple:
    every day, for one week, I will learn one new programming language, by either reading a tutorial
    or the docs for that language. I will try to pick languages that are a bit obscure not commonly
    used or that I think are interesting. Then, I will write a tutorial based on what I learned about
    the language, and post it here. The languages will be picked at random at the beginning of each day,
    so ideally there will be something interesting with each article. I call it Lang Week; overall a pretty
    self-explanatory name and concept. I plan to have this be something I do regularly; the first Lang Week
    will start this Monday. Thanks for reading, and I hope you check back in for Lang Week!
