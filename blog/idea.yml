    This is a simple idea I've ha for a little while now, and I was just thinking it might be cool to implement. The basic idea is this: making art, more specifically music, should be accessible. Anyone should be able to produce music and get it exposed to the world, regardless of whether or not they have the money or resources to do so. This project would be a sort of crowdfunded website, where aspiring musicians would apply to get a grant from a pool of donations. These applications would be reviewed and a select few (ideally as many as possible) would be granted and money given to the people whol filled them out. This is a very rough idea for a project, and in all honesty I have no idea if it would work or if it's something I even would know how to do, but if it did work out it would be cool. I would love to try and implement it, so if anyone has experience in programming or thinks they would be a good fit, email me (sugarfi@sugarfi.dev) or dm me on discord (≈ùugerfajo#8705).
