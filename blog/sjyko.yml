  sjyko is a constructed language that I am actively developing. It has several innovative principles in grammar and morphology - 
  I won't go into details here, but you can find out more at the [sjyko website](https://sjyko.github.io). The site includes a
  tutorial and a regularly updated list of words. As well, if you want to talk with me or others about or in the language,
  the Discord can be found [here](https://discord.gg/exYSY7wu7h). I hope you try and learn sjyko, and join the community!
