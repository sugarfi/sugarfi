title: Why SQLite is the Best Database

    SQLite is my personal favorite database. It is basically the 
    same syntax as other SQL variants, but it is much more 
    lightweight, and I personally prefer it to NoSQL and other 
    databases. In this article, I will describe the two reasons
    why.

    ## Lightweight

    As you might have guessed, SQLite is very lightweight. It 
    doesn't have nearly as many functions as other SQL variants.
    This may seem like a bad thing, but it can actually be good:
    hackers can't do a time-based attack if there is no `SLEEP`
    function! As well, this means SQLite is super simple and easy
    to use, and is easy on your system.

    ## File-based

    The best thing, in my opinion, about SQLite is that it is file-based.
    All that means is that it stores data in a file instead of on a server.
    This is good for several reasons: one, it's easy to protect your data:
    just change the file permissions! Two, it is stable. With MongoDB, if a 
    server goes down, you cannot access your database. With SQLite, the only server
    is your own. Finally, it's easy to delete or clear your database: you just
    remove the file. This can be very useful in development if you mess something up.
    As an added benefit, because it just writes to a file buffer, SQLite can also
    store data in RAM.

    ## Disadvantages

    Of course, SQLite isn't perfect. There is one major problem with it that I can think of:
    data is not encrypted. Unless you hash the data yourself, SQLite stores it in cleartext in a file.
    Of course, you can easily get around this using file permissions or just basic encryption,
    but it should be taken into account.

    # Closing

    That's pretty much it for this article. I hope you consider using SQLite for your next database project.
