    Esperanto, for those who don't know, is a constructed language: a spoken language, created by a human.
    I won't go into details here - you can read more online. One major subject of debate in the Esperanto
    community is the way gender is represented in nouns. Nouns referring to something female end in the suffix
    "ino", whereas nouns referring to something male have no suffix. For example, the word for "man" is "viro",
    and the word for "woman" is "virino": "viro" with an "ino" suffix. This form of "deriving" female words from
    male ones is seen by many (including myself) as sexist and misogyinist, portraying women as somehow derived
    from men. This pattern was taken from the European languages Esperanto was based on. There are several proposals
    to fix this, my favorite of which is a new suffix, "iĉo" (pronounced like "beach" without the "b" and with an "o"),
    to act as the male counterpart to "ino". With this new suffix, the word for "man" becomes "viriĉo", similar to the
    word "virino". The old word for "man", "viro", becomes gender-neutral, meanign simply "person" or similar.

    ## So why is this important?
    
    I'm describing this issue because this sexist method of "deriving" female words is present in many languages,
    including my own, English. It's quite obvious, actually: "woman" is just "man" with a prefix; "female" is just
    a prefixed form of "male". This reflects the outdated, toxicly maculine ideals of yesteryear, which for some reason
    English can't seem to shake. So how can this be rememedied?

    I propose an approach similar to the one some Esperantists are advocating: adding a prefix for male words as well. and making
    the words that used to be male gender neutral. Let's see how this could be applied. We'll use the words "man" and "woman"
    as an example. Obviously, we need some sort of male prefix for the word "man". But what? We'll just arbitrarily choose "mo",
    to be similar to the prefix "wo". I'm sure a trained linguist could come up with something better, but this will do. Thus,
    the word for a male becomes "moman", and the word "man" becomes a gender-neutral term for a person. (This has the added benefit
    of several other words, like "mankind", becoming gender neutral as well!) It's as simple as that - a new prefix. You can do the same
    for other words: "male" -> "memale" (yes, it sounds silly, but it works. And for those of you wondering why I didn't just choose
    "momale": why be consistent? It is English after all!)

    This presents one obvious problem. You can say "momale" and "memale" all you want, and use "man" and "male" as gender-neutral terms
    as much as you like, but how do you get other people to understand you? For all they know, when you use "male" you are referring to
    the non gender-neutral meaning, before you prefixed it. Unfortunately, I don't have a good answer for this. The intuitive solution
    is to simply explain your updated vocabularly to anyone listening when you say something that would not make sense without it,
    or really whenver you use it. I'm sure there is some better way that I just can't think of at the moment; if anyone can think of one,
    feel free to reach out!

    ## Closing
    
    I know that this sort of thing is not my usual subject matter on this blog, but I think it's a neat, and increasingly relevant, concept.
    I hope you enjoyed this article, and perhaps even learned something. Thanks for reading!
