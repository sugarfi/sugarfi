Hi there! I am sugarfi, a polygot and aspiring fullstack web developer. I am very interested in low-level topics and how computers work at the bare metal level. I
also enjoy design and frontend development, and I find programming languages and designing them very interesting. I know quite a lot of them, including:

- Scheme
- Python
- Go
- Rust
- C/C++
- Fish
- HTML, CSS, and JS
- Node.js
- Typescript
- Crystal

I am especially interested in Crystal, and I am begining to use it for backend on my web apps. You can read more on [my website](https://sugarfi.dev) or check out 
some of my older projects on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@sugarfi).
